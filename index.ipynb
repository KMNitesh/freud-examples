    "These notebooks may be launched [interactively on Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/glotzerlab/freud-examples/master?filepath=index.ipynb) or downloaded and run on your own system.\n",

    "\n",
    "The recommended method for installing `freud` is using conda-forge (`conda install -c conda-forge freud`), but for developers or non-conda users `freud` can also be installed from source by cloning [the Git repository](https://github.com/glotzerlab/freud).\n",
    "Note that `freud` itself requires [`numpy`](http://www.numpy.org/) and [Intel TBB](https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/) for installation.\n",
    "These can be easily installed through package managers, like conda, and if you install `freud` through conda they will be automatically installed for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these notebooks also have a number of additional dependencies.\n",
    "In particular, all of these notebooks involve making plots with either [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) or [Bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/), so you will also need to install those to run these notebooks locally.\n",
    "Note that because Bokeh uses Javascript, if you are running these notebooks using JupyterLab you will need to execute an additional command for installation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "jupyter labextension install jupyterlab_bokeh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have any issues with installing or seek more information about `freud`, please refer to the [`freud` documentation](freud.readthedocs.io/)."

    "    Most objects in `freud` store objects in C++ arrays and return NumPy arrays pointing to these underlying C++ arrays. As a result, the data in most `freud` objects is stored by reference, so a second compute call will cause the original data to be overwritten, even if you save it. For example, the following code will always print `True`:<br></br><code>box = freud.box.Box.cube(1)\n",

    "- [`freud.box`](https://freud.readthedocs.io/en/stable/box.html): The box module defines the Box object used throughout `freud` to represent periodic simulation boxes.

These nearest-neighbor-types are a common first step in more involved analyses of simulations.\n",
    "  - [LinkCell](module_intros/Locality-LinkCell.ipynb): The cell list acceleration structure is commonly used for finding particles within a certain cutoff distance of other particles.\n",
    "  - [Nearest Neighbors](module_intros/Locality-NearestNeighbors.ipynb): This class builds on top of the LinkCell class to allow neighbor list calculations that require finding at least a certain number of nearest neighbors for each particle rather than having a strict distance cutoff for finding neighbors. (*Note: this notebook might take a while to load, especially if you are running on mybinder.org*)"
