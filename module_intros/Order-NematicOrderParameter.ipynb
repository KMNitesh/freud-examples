    "The `freud.order` module provids the tools to calculate various [order parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_transition#Order_parameters) that can be used to identify phase transitions.\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the [nematic order parameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_crystal#Order_parameter), which can be used to identify systems with strong orientational ordering but no translational ordering.\n",
    "For this example, we'll start with a set of random positions in a 3D system, each with a fixed, assigned orientation.\n",
    "Then, we will show how deviations from these orientations are exhibited in the order parameter."

    "In order to work with orientations in freud, we need to do some math with quaternions.\n",

    "For the purpose of this tutorial, just consider them as 4D vectors, and know that the set of normalized (*i.e.* unit norm) 4D vectors can be used to represent rotations in 3D.\n",
    "In fact, there is a 1-1 mapping between normalize quaternions and 3x3 rotation matrices.\n",
    "Quaternions are more computationally convenient, however, because they only require storing 4 numbers rather than 9, and they can be much more easily chained together.\n",
    "For our purposes, you can largely ignore the contents of the next cell, other than to note that this is how we perform rotations of vectors using quaternions instead of matrices."
